- **Jest**: Pre-configured Jest for running unit tests with support for TypeScript.
- **Live Development**: Includes a dev server with live reloading.
- **Optimized Production Builds**: Minified JavaScript, optimized assets, and automatic cleanup.
- **Asset Handling**: Supports CSS, HTML, images, and font files by default.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Deploy your project to GitHub Pages with a single command.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lethargy2718/webpack-template.git
cd webpack-template
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will open your project in the default browser with live reloading.

### 4. Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Your production-ready files will be output to the dist folder.

### 5. Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Run Jest tests for your project. Use npm run test:watch to automatically rerun tests on file changes.

### 6. Deploy to GitHub Pages

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command will build your project, create a gh-pages branch if it doesn't exist, push the project to the branch, and deploy it to GitHub Pages.

## Running ESLint and Prettier

In order to lint and format your code, you can use the following npm scripts:

- **npm run lint**: This will run ESLint on all the TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JSON, and Markdown files in the `src` directory using ESLint.

- **npm run pretty**: This will format the TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JSON, and Markdown files in the `src` directory using Prettier.

- **npm run lint:all**: This will run ESLint on all TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JSON, and Markdown files in the project (not just in the `src` directory).

- **npm run pretty:all**: This will format all TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JSON, and Markdown files in the project using Prettier.

## How to Customize

1. **Update src/ Files**:

    - Replace `index.ts`, `style.css`, and `template.html` with your project's files.

2. **Add New Loaders/Plugins**:

    - Extend Webpack functionality by installing and configuring additional loaders/plugins (e.g. Sass).

3. **Modify Webpack Configuration**:

    - Adjust settings in `webpack.common.js`, `webpack.dev.js`, or `webpack.prod.js` as needed.

4. **Customize ESLint & Prettier**:

    - If you need to modify ESLint or Prettier settings, you can adjust the `.eslintrc.js` or `.prettierrc` files.
    - To lint and prettify the files in your src folder, run `npm run lint` and `npm run pretty` respectively.
    - To lint and prettify files in your root folder as well, run `npm run lint:all` and `npm run pretty:all` respectively. You may need to modify the `.prettierignore` and `.eslintignore` files to control which files are included in the linting and formatting process.

5. **Configure TypeScript**:

    - Adjust `tsconfig.json` to include/exclude files, set strict rules, or define custom paths for your TypeScript project.

6. **Add Jest Tests**:

    - Create test files in the `tests/` directory or alongside your source files (e.g., `index.test.ts`).
    - Run `npm test` to run Jest tests or `npm run test:watch` for continuous testing.
