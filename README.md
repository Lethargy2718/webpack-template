# Webpack Template

A basic starter Webpack template to ease project setup and streamline your workflow.

---

## Features
- **Webpack 5**: Modern module bundling and asset management.
- **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Separate development and production setups using `webpack-merge`.
- **Live Development**: Includes a dev server with live reloading.
- **Optimized Production Builds**: Minified JavaScript, optimized assets, and automatic cleanup.
- **Asset Handling**: Supports CSS, HTML, images, and font files by default.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Deploy your project to GitHub Pages with a single command.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/webpack-starter-template.git
cd webpack-starter-template
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will open your project in the default browser with live reloading.

### 4. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

Your production-ready files will be output to the `dist` folder.

### 5. Deploy to GitHub Pages
```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command will build your project, create a `gh-pages` branch if it doesn't exist, push the project to the branch, and deploy it to GitHub Pages.

## How to Customize
1. **Update `src/` Files**:
   - Replace `index.js`, `style.css`, and `template.html` with your project's assets.

2. **Add New Loaders/Plugins**:
   - Extend Webpack functionality by installing and configuring additional loaders/plugins (e.g., Babel, Sass).

3. **Modify Webpack Configuration**:
   - Adjust settings in `webpack.common.js`, `webpack.dev.js`, or `webpack.prod.js` as needed.
